Let’s consider the hotel reservation app. For this app, a user requirement may be that users must be able to view the different rooms and amenities available. Determining the right charge for different rooms and amenities may be a business requirement. A technical requirement might be that the app must run on all browsers and mobile devices. The goal should be to capture as many requirements as possible, even if it seems redundant or trivial. You must also identify any constraints of design and viability of the business model. For example, for the hotel reservation app, one constraint is that the server needs to keep the status of room availability updated at all times, which has an associated cost. Therefore, to keep the business viable, a minor convenience fee is added to the final payment.\n",

During analysis and design, there might be multiple rounds of verification and revision to create a model solution that meets all the specified requirements. Across the analysis and design phases of application development, you must maintain proper documentation with records of all updates in the design. This documentation should be clear and concise as used during the code and test phase. The final proposed design and the specified requirements are passed on to the code and test phase.\n",

Let’s review the testing phase. The tests you conduct for the unit code is called unit testing. \n",

    "An API is a software component that enables two apps that are not connected with each other to communicate. APIs help create more flexibility for programmers and enable them to request data from otherwise closed-off apps. As a result, APIs have standardized rules and functions that determine what data can be taken or modified within an app and how that process occurs. For example, the apps on your phone require you to grant permission to different features of your phone, like location, camera, audio, and recorder. An example of an app that uses an API is a weather app. Your weather app does not generate weather data itself. Instead, it simply requests information from a weather API. The API connects the software that gathers and stores weather data with the app on your mobile device. The device, in turn, provides you with a detailed forecast for the next day. \n",

To clarify the distinction between web apps and APIs, let’s consider the example of an e-commerce shopping service. When you access the e-commerce shopping service from a browser, the browser acts as the API that connects you to the web app. When you select a product, the web app checks the availability of the product and, if available, displays its price. If you try to access the e-commerce shopping service using a mobile device, the app in your device acts as the API that connects to the e-commerce shopping service. \n",

It is a good naming convention to prefix test to the class name to help distinguish between the unit class and the unit test class. Next, make the class inherit the test case class of the unit test library. For example, test case is the test case class of the unit test library. Inheriting the class allows you to leverage the existing methods in the test case class. Then, create functions in the unit testing class corresponding to each function that needs to be tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the TestMyModule class, two functions, test square and test doubler, correspond to the square and doubler functions in the mymodule unit. Note, make sure that the functions are prepended with the test in the unit test module, because only functions that start with test are run. Finally, you can create test cases. When creating the test cases, add one or more assertion methods to ensure that the unit test condition is met. One assertion function is assertEqual. Notice that the method has been added to the test case class in the code. The assertEqual function compares two values or entities and determines if they are equal. \n",

    "The method is used to check if functions are returning the correct values. One of the parameters that the assertEqual function takes is the actual value.

In the example, the first test is for the square function using the number 2, which should return a value 4 if the function executes correctly. As part of the test, first, the function is evaluated. Then, the two values are compared to see if they are equal. \n",

Finally, celery is a powerful task queue that can be used for simple background tasks and complex multi-storage programs and schedules.

    "The easiest way is to use the Python requests library. You can return the JSON from the external API to your client. However, you can also process the results before sending them back to your client. Here is an example, first, you import flask and request modules. The code here assumes you have already installed the requests library. \n",
    "You can define your route next. Use the requests library to request the openlibrary API and search for information for the author Michael Crichton. Store the response in a variable called res. Then check if the response’s status code from the openlibrary API is 200. If the response is 200, you return the JSON to the client. If the response happens to be 404, you send a message, “Something went wrong.\" Finally, in this hypothetical case, if the response is anything else, you return with a status of 500 and a message “Server error.” \n",

For example, you want to create an endpoint that returns book information by International Standard Book Number (ISBN), but instead of hard coding the ISBN, you want the client to send it as part of the URL Flask provides dynamic routing for this purpose Let's look at a concrete example: Add the variable called isbn as a dynamic part of the URL.

    " Every HTTP response contains a three-digit code indicating different error and success status, and the client is responsible for consuming this error code. Valid response code ranges from 100 to 599. The error codes are organized in categories of 100 each. \n",

Error codes from 200 to 299 indicate the request has been received and the requested operation is successful. Error codes in the 300s indicate there is a redirection on the server. Error codes in the range from 400 to 499 show an error in the request. And finally, error codes from 500 to 599 indicate an error on the server side. The APIs you will write in this course will follow this nomenclature. For example, if the client sends a GET request for an unavailable resource, you can send a 404 response back. \n",

A successful response with the status code of 200 will be sent back when the given code executes. Now, your code can return a different code than the default one. Flask allows you to send the status code in a tuple along with the response. In the code, you send back an HTML response of my first application in action, with the status code of 200.
